## Airbnb Downloader

This project aims to download the basic information of our AirBnb listings and store it locally.

AirBnB does not provide an API for this, and getting that info for each one of our listings manually, is a pain. I therefore created this tool to automate the process.

Currently, it only extracts:
- Description
- Photos

I plan to add more in the future.

### Dependencies

- [Rod](https://github.com/go-rod/rod).

### How to run
